-- These tests pass without the fix when either of
--   - optimize_read_in_window_order = 0 and optimize_read_in_order = 0
--   - ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization = 1
-- However it is better to leave the settings as randomized because we run
-- stateless tests quite a few times during a PR, so if a bug is introduced
-- then there is a big chance of catching it. Furthermore, randomized settings
-- might identify new bugs.
